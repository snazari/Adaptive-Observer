# Adaptive-Observer
An adaptive scheme is used to estimate state &amp; parameters for SISO systems
An adaptive observer in Simulink to simultaneously estimate the state and parameters of a SISO nth order linear system from Input/Output data. 
This is the example that is simulated in the paper: "Synthesis of an adaptive observer using Lyapunov's direct method" by Kudva & Narendra Int. J. Control 1973.
